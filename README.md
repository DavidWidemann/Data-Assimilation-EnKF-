# Data-Assimilation-EnKF-
Ensemble Kalman Filter MATLAB code

The ensemblekfilter.m function written in MATLAB implements the ensemble kalman filter (EnKF). The EnKF assimilates measurements, noise and a model of a state (or states) and calucates a new state forward in time at the next time interval, denoted k+1.
